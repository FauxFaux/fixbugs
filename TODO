Immediate:
    3 specs from paper
        - lock/unlock
            - subtype predicate

    u calculus side conditions
        - eval
    actions
        ADD METHOD type metavar( type metavar, ... ) statement TO metavar WHERE
            - implement in main
    more extensive side condition testing

context sensitive wildcards

Next:
    Deal with multiple bytecode files
    class predicates

Small Delay:
    finish off adding all types
    license code
    move all debug output to logging
    Prefix Operators

Big Delay:
    Alias Analysis?
    write tutorial
