Immediate:
    3 specs from paper
            - type predicate - get names+type mappings from domain, and hook into eval
            - /*and type lock is 'java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock'*/
                - Generalise domains and cast to Int for line numbers
                - rework type comparator to use domains/environments
            - stmt predicate
                - pattern matching
                - test: stmt indices and rewriting
        - lock/unlock
            - Add marker node for outbound exceptions
        - jdbc
        - List Synchronisation
            - fix spec

    u calculus side conditions
        - eval
    actions
        ADD METHOD type metavar( type metavar, ... ) statement TO metavar WHERE
            - implement in main
    more extensive side condition testing

context sensitive wildcards

Next:
    Deal with multiple bytecode files
    Test with multiple methods
    Add new stuff to kindchecker
        - stmt,NamedMethod, mu, ADD METHOD, Strategies
        - check no ident can be 'stmtN' where N is a number

Small Delay:
    finish off adding all types
    license code
    move all debug output to logging
    Prefix Operators

Big Delay:
    Alias Analysis?
    write tutorial
    subtype predicate
    Testing Web Page
        - try to compile resulting code
    Nested Block Pattern Matching
