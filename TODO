Immediate:
    mu calculus side conditions
        - eval
    more extensive side condition testing

Next:
    license code
    move all debug output to logging
    generate vim stuff from scala parser

Reliability
    Deal with multiple bytecode files
    Test with multiple methods
    context sensitive wildcards

Future:
    Alias Analysis?
    write tutorial
    subtype predicate
    Testing Web Page
        - try to compile resulting code
    Nested Block Pattern Matching
    actions
        ADD METHOD type name( type metavar, ... ) statement TO metavar WHERE
            - implement in main
    finish off adding all types

Specifications:
    - lock/unlock
        - /*and type lock is 'java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock'*/
        - Add marker node for outbound exceptions
        - safety side condition
    - jdbc
    - List Synchronisation
        - fix spec
