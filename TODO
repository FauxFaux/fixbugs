Immediate:
    3 specs from paper
            - type predicate - get names+type mappings from domain, and hook into eval
            - stmt predicate
        - lock/unlock
        - jdbc
            - boolean literals
            - catch blocks
        - List Synchronisation
            - fix spec
            - method predicate

    u calculus side conditions
        - eval
    actions
        ADD METHOD type metavar( type metavar, ... ) statement TO metavar WHERE
            - implement in main
    more extensive side condition testing

context sensitive wildcards

Next:
    Deal with multiple bytecode files

Small Delay:
    finish off adding all types
    license code
    move all debug output to logging
    Prefix Operators

Big Delay:
    Alias Analysis?
    write tutorial
    subtype predicate
