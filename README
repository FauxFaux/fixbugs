1. Dependancies:

The following have known working versions in the lib/ folder:

Scala
ScalaCheck ( http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/)
ASM
slf4j and an slf4j backend (for example log3j)

Additionally you will need an eclipse JEE install.

2. Compiling

a. Create an ant.props file,  with the following:
    i. scala.home - the directory that scala is installed into
    ii. ECLIPSE_HOME - the directory that eclipse plugin jars are installed into
    iii. log4j.loc - the location of a log4j.properties file, a debugging one is shipped with the code at: etc/log4j.properties

b. ant build compiles the code.

3. Running

Fixbugs can be run using the following command:
    ant run -Da="SomeFile.java" -Dc="SomeSpecification.trans"
